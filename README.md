# Interval-valued Data Analysis

## Principal Component Analysis of Interval-Valued Data and Anomaly Detection

This repository holds code that implements the methods proposed by Lin et al. (2022) - https://doi.org/10.1007/s11634-022-00527-1
It also holds the code for the presentation "Air Quality Data Analysis with Symbolic Principal Components" which applies the previous methods.

## Code

 - `spca.R` contains the implementation of the SPCA method.
 - `sym.R` contains helper functions related to the symbolic nature of the SPCA method.
 - `utils.R` contains miscellaneous utilities.
